# Checkpoint - Grid Consolidation Working (10/26/2025)

## Current Status: WORKING
This checkpoint represents a working state before fixing disconnected components issue.

## What's Working
1. ✅ Bidirectional edges for BFS connectivity
2. ✅ Edge deduplication (prevents double-counting roads)
3. ✅ Grid consolidation (merges tiny grids into large ones)
4. ✅ Cleanup step (adds orphaned roads to nearest grids)
5. ✅ No grids < 1.5 miles

## Test Results (Pet 111)
- Location: 27.8502, -82.8045 (1.35 mile radius)
- Total roads: 13,402 segments, 211.36 miles
- **Final grids: 32** (reduced from 195 initial grids)
- Grid distribution:
  - 28 grids ≥ 6.0 miles
  - 2 grids 3.0-6.0 miles
  - 2 grids 1.5-3.0 miles
  - 0 grids < 1.5 miles ✓

## Code Changes

### 1. Bidirectional Edges (lines 1317-1349)
```python
# Add edges from ways
for way in result.ways:
    # Check if road is one-way
    oneway = way.tags.get('oneway', 'no')
    is_oneway = oneway in ['yes', 'true', '1', '-1']

    for i in range(len(way_nodes) - 1):
        u, v = way_nodes[i], way_nodes[i+1]

        # Add forward edge
        G.add_edge(u, v, highway=highway_type, geometry=line, length=length_meters, name=way.tags.get('name', ''))

        # Add reverse edge for bidirectional roads
        if not is_oneway:
            reverse_line = LineString([...])
            G.add_edge(v, u, highway=highway_type, geometry=reverse_line, length=length_meters, name=way.tags.get('name', ''))
```

### 2. Edge Deduplication (lines 1367-1376)
```python
seen_edges = set()  # Track unique edge pairs

for u, v, key, data in G.edges(keys=True, data=True):
    # Skip duplicate edges (bidirectional creates A->B and B->A)
    edge_pair = tuple(sorted([u, v]))
    if edge_pair in seen_edges:
        continue
    seen_edges.add(edge_pair)

    # Extract edge as road...
```

### 3. Grid Consolidation (lines 633-676)
```python
MIN_GRID_SIZE = 1.5  # Grids smaller than 1.5 miles are "tiny"

large_grids = []
tiny_grids = []

for grid in grids:
    grid_miles = sum(r['length_meters'] for r in grid['roads']) / 1609.34
    if grid_miles >= MIN_GRID_SIZE:
        large_grids.append(grid)
    else:
        tiny_grids.append(grid)

# Merge tiny grids into nearest large grids
for tiny_grid in tiny_grids:
    nearest_large = min(large_grids, key=lambda g: distance(tiny_grid, g))
    nearest_large['roads'].extend(tiny_grid['roads'])

# Replace grids with only large grids
grids = large_grids

# Recalculate grid totals
for grid in grids:
    grid['total_miles'] = sum(r['length_meters'] for r in grid['roads']) / 1609.34
    grid['roads_count'] = len(grid['roads'])
```

### 4. Cleanup Step (lines 678-723)
```python
unassigned_roads = [r for r in roads if r['id'] not in assigned_road_ids]

if unassigned_roads:
    # Add ALL orphaned roads to nearest grid (no distance limit)
    for road in unassigned_roads:
        nearest_grid = min(grids, key=lambda g: distance(road, g))
        nearest_grid['roads'].append(road)
        assigned_road_ids.add(road['id'])

    # Recalculate totals after cleanup
    for grid in grids:
        grid['total_miles'] = sum(r['length_meters'] for r in grid['roads']) / 1609.34
        grid['roads_count'] = len(grid['roads'])
```

## Known Issue (Next Fix)
**Disconnected Components Within Grids**
- Some grids contain multiple disconnected road sections
- Connecting roads between sections are being excluded
- Need to add bridge roads to make each grid fully connected

## Files Modified
- `/opt/petsearch/server_geographic_grids.py`
  - Lines 1317-1349: Bidirectional edges
  - Lines 1367-1376: Deduplication
  - Lines 633-676: Consolidation
  - Lines 678-723: Cleanup

## To Restore This State
```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
# or
sudo systemctl restart petsearch.service
```

## Database State
- Pet 111: search-60b3c2a3-12b8-499f-bcb5-3b22aa537e85 (32 grids, active)
- Pet 112: search-718520c2-80ba-49a9-800c-1f441e7ca9ca (37 grids, active)

## Next Steps
1. Add connectivity checking for each grid
2. Find bridge roads between disconnected components
3. Add bridge roads to make grids fully connected
4. Verify each grid is ONE connected network
